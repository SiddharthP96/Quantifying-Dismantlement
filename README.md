# Quantifying-Dismantlement
I took a course namely, ‘Topics in Networks’ by Dr. Anirban Banerjee during which I worked on a research project with him. I came up with a novel measure to quantify the dismantlement in disconnected networks, by modifying the measure of regularity in the Szemredi Regularity Lemma.
